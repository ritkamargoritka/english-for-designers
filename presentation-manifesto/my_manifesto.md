# My Design Manifesto

## 1. Talent versus Persistence
Success in design, as in any other industry, depends not so much on innate talent as on persistence, constant learning and development. Anyone can become a professional if they work hard enough.

## 2. Design's Déjà Vu
Everything is cyclical processes. Trends have the property of returning, but with a new interpretation.  Designers, recognizing this cyclicality, can more effectively predict future trends and create and influence relevant designs.

## 3. Beyond the Trend
Designers play a key role in shaping new trends. They don't just follow trends, but set new directions, experiment and create unique concepts.

## 4. Once Upon a Time ... Сlient and Designer will be together
Each designer has their own unique style and vision. It is this diversity that allows them to meet the needs of different clients and create a variety of projects.

## 5. The Art of Influence
Design can be a tool to create a better world. Designers have a responsibility to make sure that their work is not only beautiful, but also useful and socially relevant.

## Сonclusion
Design is not just about making beautiful things, it is a creative process that requires constant development, experimentation and social responsibility. Designers play an important role in shaping our world, and our future depends on their work.
