# My Design Manifesto

## 1. Talent versus Persistence
Success in design, as in any other industry, depends not so much on innate talent as on persistence, constant learning and development. Anyone can become a professional if they work hard enough.

## 2. Design's Déjà Vu
Everything is cyclical processes. Trends have the property of returning, but with a new interpretation.  Designers, recognizing this cyclicality, can more effectively predict future trends and create and influence relevant designs.

## 3. Beyond the Trend
Designers play a key role in shaping new trends. They don't just follow trends, but set new directions, experiment and create unique concepts.

## 4. Сlient and Designer will be together
