> The story of a little girl who from childhood loved to draw, sing and dance, was immersed in creativity and art. She always liked to make videos as a memory and ceremoniously present them to her relatives. Once she was given a handicraft set, to make picture frames out of plaster. So this 8 year old girl came up with a business idea to make photo frames, paint and sell.
> On every family holiday, when relatives and friends came, she opened her store and earned her first money, which she then gave to her mother to save.
