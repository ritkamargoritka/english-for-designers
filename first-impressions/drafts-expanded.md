Hi! Iâ€™m Marharyta, a graphic designer with over 3 years of experience. I help turn ideas into memorable brands by creating logos, interfaces, and visual identities that stand out and get results.  

Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked with various young companies and startups, helping them discover their unique style and reach new heights. For me, design is not just about aesthetics; itâ€™s a tool to tell a brandâ€™s story and make it truly recognizable.  

Ready to make your brand shine? Letâ€™s create something amazing together! ðŸŒŸ

> The story of a little girl who from childhood loved to draw, sing and dance, was immersed in creativity and art. She always liked to make videos as a memory and ceremoniously present them to her relatives. Once she was given a handicraft set, to make picture frames out of plaster. So this 8 year old girl came up with a business idea to make photo frames, paint and sell.
> On every family holiday, when relatives and friends came, she opened her store and earned her first money, which she then gave to her mother to save.

> All my life I loved to create something creative, from presentations with mega clutch effects to some handmade stuffs and paintings, which are still kept by the connoisseurs of my art of those times (p.s. they are not my parents). Also I've done both vocal, dance, modeling, and even writing rhymes, but never focused on drawing. 
> I moved to the Czech Republic at 17 and started looking for myself and who I want to be in the future, who knew that the answer was so close, but I went to the University of Economics, where I forced myself to learn law, and at the same time I realized what I wanted to do and started studied design by myself.
> In two years I decided that I definitely wanted to study design. I dropped out of economics university and enrolled as a graphic designer.
