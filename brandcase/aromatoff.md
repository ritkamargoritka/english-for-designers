# Case Study: Aromatoff ‚Äî Scent Redefined

## üïØÔ∏è Project Overview

**Aromatoff** is a fragrance brand that went through a complete transformation ‚Äî from name and product concept to a bold new visual identity. Originally launched as *Auto Essence* (yes, even car perfumes can glow up), the brand decided to pivot toward a more sophisticated lifestyle segment, focusing on scented candles and aroma sprays.

**My task was to lead the rebranding:** visual system and style that could grow and evolve ‚Äî just like the people lighting those candles.

## üß† Concept & Background

After some time on the market, the client decided that it was time to *leave the past behind, elegantly*. They wanted a shift:

- From *soft & decorative* ‚Üí to *structured & modern*  
- From *generic* ‚Üí to *expressive and memorable*

They came to me with a simple request:  
> ‚ÄúWe want something bold, but also poetic. Something strict, but still emotional.‚Äù

And so **Aromatoff** was born ‚Äî a name that evokes scent (*aroma*), softness (*off* like a whisper), and a touch of timeless elegance that feels both international and intimate.

---

## üõ† Process

We started from scratch, so every part of the brand identity was reconsidered:

- A new name to reflect a calmer, more mature mood  
- A visual concept that could flex and adapt to different scents and packaging  
- A modular brand system where mood, color, and pattern could shift with every product line

## üî§ Logo

The main wordmark is set in a clean serif with a sharp, geometric twist ‚Äî particularly visible in the stylized **A**s with extended legs. It‚Äôs minimal, modern, and full of subtle personality.

Above the wordmark sits a **monogram** made of two mirrored ‚ÄúF‚Äùs, forming an **A** in the negative space ‚Äî a clever nod to the brand name. This symbol works as a seal or icon across applications and embodies the new conceptual depth.

## üé® Color & Flexibility

At the brand's core lies a **monochrome system**: black and white are used to create a sense of calm elegance. This also allows the design to adapt to each scent.

Each fragrance uses its own **color variation and marbled pattern**, inspired by the emotion of the aroma.

> *Cherry*, for example, gets dark red swirls ‚Äî rich and intense, just like biting into the fruit too soon and pretending you‚Äôre fine.

---

## üåÄ Pattern System

The swirling patterns are more than just visual flair ‚Äî they serve as **emotional landscapes** for each scent. Each one was crafted and carefully refined to evoke the essence of the fragrance: like flowing ink, rising smoke, or softly melting wax.

They help translate aroma into mood and appear across various brand touchpoints, including:

- Product labels  
- Packaging boxes  
- Print collateral

## üçí Real Product Example: ‚ÄúCherry‚Äù

For the *Cherry* scent ‚Äî used on both a soy wax candle and room spray ‚Äî I created:

- Custom label with marbled red-black pattern  
- Clear scent name in script font for a touch of softness  
- Amber glass packaging for warmth and depth

> It‚Äôs giving: *one perfectly sliced cherry tart.*

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenge

The biggest challenge was making something strict ‚Äî but not boring. The original brand leaned decorative, so swinging too far into minimalism risked losing warmth.

The solution? A system of contrasts:

- clean logo / expressive patterns  
- monochrome base / shifting color per scent

---

## ‚úÖ Outcome

The result is a flexible, elegant identity that can grow with the brand and hold many product variations without losing cohesion. **Aromatoff** is now a brand that speaks in **textures**, not trends ‚Äî and whispers *‚Äúpremium‚Äù* without screaming it.
