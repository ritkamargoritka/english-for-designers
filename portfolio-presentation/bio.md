## Hi, nice to meet you!
Have you read Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov?

I'm Master graphic designer Marharyta, who creates logo, visual identity, posters, apps/webs interfaces and even motion design.

**Let's tell your story through design!**

## About me
Iâ€™m a graphic designer who believes that every brand is unique and has the potential to shine in the world. I help turn ideas into memorable brands by creating logos, interfaces, and visual identities that truly stand out and deliver results.

With 3 years of experience in design, Iâ€™ve collaborated with young companies, startups, and bloggers, helping them discover their unique style and reach new heights. For me, design is not just about aestheticsâ€”itâ€™s a powerful tool that tells a brandâ€™s story and makes it recognizable.

Ready to make your brand a star? Letâ€™s create something amazing together! ðŸŒŸ

## Something more about me
All my life I loved to create something creative, from presentations with mega clutch effects to some handmade stuffs and paintings, which are still kept by the connoisseurs of my art of those times (p.s. they are not my parents). Also I've done both vocal, dance, modeling, and even writing rhymes, but never focused on drawing. I moved to the Czech Republic at 17 and started looking for myself and who I want to be in the future, who knew that the answer was so close, but I went to the University of Economics, where I forced myself to learn law, and at the same time I realized what I wanted to do and started studied design by myself. In two years I decided that I definitely wanted to study design. I dropped out of economics university and enrolled as a graphic designer.
